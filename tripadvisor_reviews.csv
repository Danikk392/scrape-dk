Abby N,"December 27, 2024","Loved the food, so did my family, but two stars because I told the waitress I was gluten free. She assured me they'd swap my toast for GF toast, and yet here i am having a full blown gluten allergy response. So no, she did not send it right or the kitchen didn't listen, either way this is serious. I won't be going back.",2

From the speciality drinks at the bar to super delicious food at the table. Thank you Mix, your fabulous staff will see us all soon. ðŸŒ´",5
Mark W,"May 29, 2023","Over the ten years that my two older grandsons have been students at Cornell, our three generation family of six has enjoyed numerous outstanding meals in Ithaca. Mix was by far the worst. 

There were a few enjoyable items. The most universally enjoyed was the onion rings we shared. Noting that onion rings arenâ€™t an item on the menu, but that onion rings come with a couple of items on the menu, I requested onion rings from our waitress. She immediately said that they didnâ€™t offer onion rings, but I insisted that she ask, and emphasized that I would gladly pay whatever the charge. She came back with a large plate of onion rings, which four of us shared and enjoyed. The charge of $8 for the onion rings was perfectly reasonable. Also, two in our party of six enjoyed their Caesar salads. 

A good waitress would have offered to inquire if possibly the chef could prepare a plate of onion rings, but our waitress consistently responded negatively to whatever we asked. 

I requested only dark meat chicken in my order of fried chicken. The waitress insisted that they served only dark meat chicken, later claiming that dark meat was less expensive than white meat. The chicken she served me was filets of white meat chicken. When I said that the chicken was white meat filets, the waitress insisted that I was wrong. I should have sent it back to the kitchen, but I didnâ€™t want to ruin our celebratory mood of my grandsonâ€™s graduation. 

It turned out that everyone of our party of six had been unhappy with what they ordered. In each case, they didnâ€™t want to ruin the mood. One ordered his ribeye steak medium and it came out medium rare. Another ordered a ribeye, but left over half of the steak, because the half was all fat. 

Three hated their burgers which they found overdone. The hamburger patties were small and overcooked. Once again, no one complained because they didnâ€™t want to ruin the mood. 

I feel guilty because I didnâ€™t set the right example of sending my order back to the kitchen when it wasnâ€™t right. So at least Iâ€™m sharing our familyâ€™s unhappiness with Mix on Trip Advisor. When I looked Mix up in Trip Advisor, I was shocked to see its Number One ranking among all of Ithacaâ€™s exceptionally fine assortment of restaurants. For the six of us, it was the Worst. Worst Food, The worst Service.
Absurdly High Prices. The Worst.",1
Vladimir S,"July 8, 2022","They are proud about their steaks. We went for sea food and salad. Sea food was excellent (octopus and red snapper). As far as salad goes, their shef likes smoked gouda. I would prefer mozzarella or even provolone.",5

aztempe,"July 29, 2021","We ate at the bar at Mix during a girls trip to Ithaca. The bartender was super friendly and offered great recommendations. The cocktails were creative and tasty. I had a fig vodka cocktail that was delicious. We enjoyed our beet salad and the hot popovers were a nice touch. Overall, this was a great dining experience and I highly recommend Mix.",5
Darlene P,"November 15, 2020","Their menu was super varied -- everything from classic Thai noodle bowls, to steaks, to sandwiches. The food is beautifully presented and its apparent much thought was put into each dish. The chef came out to speak to the patrons at each table, which was a really nice touch.",5
